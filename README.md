### Usage 
First of all you have to connect you eqipment to the right pins so connect your speaker with pin 8 and your Button with pin 3  

You have to Start the Arduino when you are going to sleep then the program will output a tone if this happens it means your setup works!

The script will sleep 7 hours if you want to change this go for it!  
Then it will play a tone for one minute and waits until you press the button
